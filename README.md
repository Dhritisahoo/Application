 Stock Portfolio Dashboard

This is a stock portfolio dashboard built using Dash, a web application framework for Python. 
The dashboard allows you to select stocks, specify weights for different investor types (conservative, moderate, aggressive), 
and calculates various metrics such as portfolio returns, risk, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and growth.
